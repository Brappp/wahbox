- ESC key protection
- Transparent background

### 3. Supporting Infrastructure

#### Helper Classes:
- **GameDrawing**: Static helper for in-game overlay rendering
  - Safe overlay window management
  - World-to-screen coordinate conversion
  - Drawing primitives (dots, lines, circles, text)
  - Error handling and cleanup

#### Data Files:
- Created Data/sounds directory structure for future alert sounds
- Updated project file to include resources

### 4. Integration with WahBox Architecture

Both modules have been properly integrated into the WahBox module system:
- Extend from BaseUtilityModule
- Implement proper initialization and disposal
- Support configuration persistence
- Display in module dashboard
- Have their own windows
- Support enable/disable functionality

## Files Modified/Created:

1. **Modified Files:**
   - `F:\Github\wahdori\wahbox\Modules\Utility\RadarModule.cs` - Complete rewrite with full Wahdar functionality
   - `F:\Github\wahdori\wahbox\Modules\Utility\SpeedometerModule.cs` - Complete rewrite with full Zoomies functionality
   - `F:\Github\wahdori\wahbox\WahBox.csproj` - Added sound resources

2. **New Files:**
   - `F:\Github\wahdori\wahbox\Helpers\GameDrawing.cs` - In-game overlay drawing helper
   - `F:\Github\wahdori\wahbox\Data\sounds\` - Directory for alert sounds

## Features NOT Integrated:

1. **From Wahdar:**
   - NavMesh IPC integration (vNavmesh pathfinding)
   - Object List Window (separate table view)
   - Sound file playback (files need to be copied)
   - Some advanced object categories

2. **From Zoomies:**
   - NyanCat renderer
   - Debug window
   - Advanced statistics/history tracking

## Next Steps:

1. Copy sound files from `F:\Github\wahdori\otherplugins\Wahdar-master\Wahdar-master\Data\sounds\` to `F:\Github\wahdori\wahbox\Data\sounds\`
2. Test the integration in-game
3. Consider adding NavMesh support if you use vNavmesh plugin
4. Add sound playback functionality for alerts
5. Consider implementing the NyanCat renderer for fun

## Usage:

Both modules should now appear in your WahBox dashboard under the Utility category. You can:
- Enable/disable each module
- Click to open their respective windows
- Configure settings through the module dashboard
- The radar will track objects and show alerts
- The speedometer will display your movement speed

The integration maintains the core functionality of both original plugins while adapting them to work within the WahBox framework.
